<ul>
<li>August 2008<br>NEMBASE4 beta launched containing 62 species and 679,480 ESTs<br><br>
<li>01 September 2007<br>NEMBASE3 launched on new server architecture<br><br>
<li>August 2007<br>NEMBASE3 interface reworked and beta testing commences<br><br>
<li>March 2007<br>Annotation complete for NEMBASE3: predictions of proteins with prot4EST, families with MCL tribe and Domains with ProDom<br><br>
<li>March 2005<br>NEMBASE3 contains 37 species<br><br>
<li>March 2005<br>Database Freeze for NEMBASE3 development<br><br><br>
<li>March 2005<br>NEMBASE2 development ceases<br><br>
<li>September 2004<br>Nembase has been moved to a more powerful server. Nembase contains now datasets for 30 species.<br><br>
<li>6th February 2003<br>Haemonchus contortus dataset updated.<br><br>
<li>6th February 2003<br>Ascaris suum dataset updated.<br><br>
<li>31st January 2003<br>Teladorsagia circumcincta dataset added.<br><br>
<li>29th October 2002<br>Necator americanus dataset has been
updated.<br><br>
<li>16th October 2002<br>Toxocara canis dataset has been
added.<br><br>
<li>1st October 2002<br>Ascaris lumbricoides dataset has been
added.<br><br> 
<li>7th June 2002<br>You can now search the clusters by library
expression for all nematodes hosted by NEMBASE.<br><br> 
<li>21st February 2002<br>Protein translations for Ascaris, Brugia
Onchocerca and Haemonchus datasets have been performed.  These pages
(accesible off the cluster pages) are experimental please note the
data is very much in flux.<br><br> 
<li>5th February 2002<br>Funk annotation for Brugia added.<br><br> 
<li>25th January 2002<br>Ascaris suum data updated.<br><br> 
<li>7th January 2002<br>Trichuris muris data updated.<br><br> 
<li>3rd January 2002<br>Haemonchus contortus data updated.<br><br> 
<li>3rd January 2002<br>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis dataset added.<br><br> 
<li>3rd January 2002<br>Brugia malayi blast dated updated.<br><br> 

<li>5th October 2001<br>PhyloView now available on the
annotation search page for all nematode datasets. See
<a href="http://xyala.cap.ed.ac.uk/nembase3/phylograph.html"> PhyloView
</a>page for details.<br><br> 

<li>5th October 2001<br>NEMBASE back on-line.<br><br> 

<li>5th October 2001<br>NEMBASE temporarily unavailable due
to software updating<br><br> 

<li>17 September 2001<br>Haemonchus and Ascaris datasets
updated.<br><br> 

<li>14 September 2001<br>Trace data, where available is now
accessible via the web interface. On the right side of the cluster view 
graphic, a red box indicates the trace for this sequence is available,
click to view. A blue box indicates no trace data is available
(NB No trace data is currently available for Brugia or Onchocerca).<br><br> 

<li>22 August 2001<br>Cluster alignment views available. By clicking 
on the consensus in the contig view graphic, you will bring up a page showing 
the sequence alignment used for generation of the cluster. The Consensus
 sequence is coloured according to quality of prediction.<br><br> 

<li>17 August 2001<br>Onchocerca clusters now available for searching,
as with the Brugia clusters, the Oncho dataset numbering system 
is consistent with previous published work.<br><br> 

<li>13 August 2001<br>Clusters have been re-assembled using PHRAP to
include quality data (where quality data is unavailable e.g. the majority of the
brugia clusters, 'pseudo' quality scores of 15 and 50 have been assumed for EST
and full length sequences respectively). This step has been taken as part of
the process to generate peptide sequences from the data (work in progress).
Consensi views now include quality information.<br><br> 

<li>6 August 2001<br>Haemonchus clusters brought back online.<br><br> 
<li>6 August 2001<br>Brugia malayi cluster numbering system
now consistent with previous published cluster numbers.<br><br>
<li>6 August 2001<br>Phyloview now offering a choice of datasets
(see stage specificity search page).
<br><br>
<li>2 August 2001<br>Phyloview - New Java application to investigate the 
phylogenetic relationships of groups of clusters. Accessible under the 
Stage Specificity search page. N.B Only available to users running IE 5.0 or
greater or Netscape 6. Other users can only obtain the static view.<br><br>
<li>31 July 2001<br>
Haemonchus Dataset temporarily removed due to problems
in Blast output
